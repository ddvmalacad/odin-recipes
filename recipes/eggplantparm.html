    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, 
                and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl and beaten eggs in 
                a third shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip sliced eggplant first in flour, then in beaten eggs, and finally coat with bread crumb mixture. 
                Place coated eggplant on a tray and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place breaded eggplant rounds in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; work in batches if necessary. 
                Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, flip each round, and cook until desired crispiness is achieved, 4 to 6 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Top each eggplant round with marinara sauce and 1 slice of mozzarella cheese. 
                Place the basket back in the air fryer and cook until cheese has started to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Repeat with remaining eggplant, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
