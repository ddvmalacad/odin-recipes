# odin-recipes

The current project allowed me to create a homepage for food recipes.
In this project, I learned how to create multiple html pages that can be linked with each other
I am now able to use images for my html pages
I also am able to maximize the use of ordered and unordered lists as demonstrated by the ingredients and steps section of the project

Overall, this project has allowed me to practice the things I've learned over the past few lessons so that theory becomes practice.

The most important thing I've learned from this project is the importance of Git. The process of making commits made me appreciate Git's value.
